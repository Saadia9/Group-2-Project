        instructions:['Preheat your oven to 450°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.', ' Roast the cashews. Dump the cashews onto the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated for no more than 5 minutes – toss the nuts halfway through the baking process to ensure they roast evenly. Quick note, cashews (and all nuts) can burn very quickly, so keep a sharp eye on them as they roast. Once the cashews are done, dump them onto your cutting board or a small plate to cool.',' Bake the crispy tofu. Tear the tofu into small bite-size pieces and dump it onto the same parchment-lined baking sheet used for the cashews. Drizzle the tofu with avocado oil and a generous sprinkle of kosher salt, and toss to coat. Bake the tofu in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until it’s golden brown and crisp. Quick note, I prefer tearing the tofu instead of cutting it, as the little craggy nooks from tearing the tofu get super crispy.','Prep the salad. While the tofu bakes, prep cabbage, scallions, edamame and roughly chop the roasted cashews. Add everything into a large serving bowl.','Make the sesame ginger dressing. The last thing to prepare while the tofu bakes is the dressing. Add all the ingredients into a bowl or cup and whisk to combine until silky smooth. The dressing might look broken as you whisk it, but keep whisking and you’ll see it emulsify quickly. Taste and adjust seasonings and salt as needed. This dressing is on the sweeter side, so if you prefer it more savory, reduce the honey by half. ','Make the sesame ginger dressing. The last thing to prepare while the tofu bakes is the dressing.
